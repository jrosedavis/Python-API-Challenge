# Python API Homework - Written Report: Draw three correct conclusions from the data for Pymaceuticals. 


The analysis of the weather for 547 cities across the world of varying distance from the equator was performed. A series of scatter plots and linear regression were conducted to analyze the relationship between weather characteristics and latitude. A point of reference on the geographic coordinate system is referenced by its longitude and its latitude values. The line of latitude midway between the poles is the equator, which defines the line of zero latitude. Latitude values are measured relative to the equator, ranging -90 degrees at the South Pole to +90 degrees at the North Pole.

Per this analysis, the following weather characteristics of 547 cities was compared to the latitude coordinate of that city: Maximum temperature, humidity (%), cloudiness (%), and wind speed (mph). 

For the scatter plot latitude vs maximum temperature, there is an obvious pattern that shows that as latitude increases, temperature decreases. This is because temperature is inversely related to latitude as it gets warmer towards the equator and cooler towards the poles. From the scatter plot latitude vs cloudiness (%), there does not appear to be a relationship between the dependent and independent variable, which is further supported by the N. and S. Hemisphere plots of cloudiness (%) vs latitude linear regression. From these plots, we also found the R2 values, which are both low, indicating that the data points are further from the regression line, which is visible in the scatter plot as the data points are spread out away and more widely distributed from the regression line.
